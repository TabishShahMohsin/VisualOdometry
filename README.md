# SubSense: Underwater Visual Perception

SubSense is a Python-based project focused on underwater visual perception and later odometry, specifically for detecting and analyzing features, tracking, and finding trajectory in submerged environments. It implements various computer vision algorithms for feature detection, corner detection, and line intersection analysis, primarily geared towards tasks like tile and object recognition from underwater imagery.

# Pose Estimation Project

This project aims to estimate the 6-DoF pose of a camera relative to a grid pattern.

## Structure
- `/data_generation`: Scripts to generate synthetic datasets.
- `/dataset`: The generated images and labels.
- `/src`: Source code for the model, dataset loading, and training.
- `/models`: Saved trained model weights.
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis.
